This Project starts with Create-React-App for Client Environment & NPM init for Server Environment.

This Website is all about real-time chat website was developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, Chakra UI, and Socket.io.
I create this Website with the help of popular web development stack that uses JavaScript for both the client-side and server-side programming.
I used Chakra UI which a React component library that provides customizable UI components.
I also used Socket.io which is again a library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.

This real-time chat website provides a platform for users to communicate with each other in real-time.
Users can create an account, sign in, and join chat rooms. They can also send and receive messages and view the online status of other users.
The website uses Socket.io to ensure that messages are delivered instantly to all connected clients.

Chakra UI is used to design the website's user interface, providing users with an intuitive and responsive design.
It provided me pre-built UI components that are customizable and I used to create a consistent look and feel throughout the website.

Overall, the real-time chat website is a great example of how MERN stack, Chakra UI, and Socket.io can be used together to create a fully functional and engaging real-time chat application.
